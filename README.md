PyUtils for CG:SHOP 2026


## Development

You can build the C++ of this project in place by `python setup.py develop`.
This will automatically take care of the conan dependencies and compile the C++ code.
Then you can install the python package in editable mode by `pip install -e .`.
After that you only need to recompile the C++ code by `python setup.py develop` if you change something in the C++ code.
